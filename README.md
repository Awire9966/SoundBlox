## NOTICE
This is not a cheat. This does not give players an unfair advantange in game. It only replaces the audio files.

## Coder's Notice
- The packages directory is missing, when loading the project please wait for visual studio to restore the packages.

## Info
- Files MUST be in .ogg or .mp3 depending on what they are in the sounds directory.
- The 2 file windows that open up are just like file explorer.
- This doesnt let you play these files from radios and stuff (Due to it being on your end only.)
- When converting files, the file paths MUST NOT contain spaces.
